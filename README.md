# TaskBuddy
Web application designed for roommates to create, assign, divide and track progress of tasks.
<div>
<p>	Entire Application was developed using Agile methodologies following the complete SDLC from requirement analysis, design, development to testing. This project is totally divided into 3 iterations. 
<br/><br/>
<p> The following are the user stories for the entire 3 iterations. </p>
<br/>
<p> Iteration 1: </p>
<ul>
<li> User Story1 : Display list of all the users. (Note: The user can click on adding Add user button and the added user shows up in the list of users. </li>
<li> User Story2 : Display list of all the tasks with task points. </li>
<li> User Story3 : A task can be assigned when creating a task and the assigned task appears on the dashboard of assigned user.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p> Iteration 2: </p>
<ul>
<li> User Story1 : Login. (Implemented the Login functionality using the facebook authentication.</li>
<li> User Story2 : Minimum task point to be completed by users. (This is done by assigning each user a minimum of 50 points to be completed per week and the users marks as task complete/incomplete, the minimum to be completed gets increased/decreased) </li>
<li> User Story3 : List incomplete tasks. (This is implemented by showing the incompleted tasks at the start of table sorted by their due date)</li>
<li> User Story4 : Recurring Tasks. (This is implemented by creating an option which says recurring or non recurring (daily,weekly,monthly) at the time of task creation.</li>
<li> User Story5 : Mark task as complete. (This is implemented by checking the status checkbox.Once a task is marked as completed it moves down the end of list sorted by its due date)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p> Iteration 3: </p>
<ul>
<li> User Story1 : Reusable Task </li>
<li> User Story2 : Auto adjustment of points based on the task completed.</li>
<li> User Story3 : Recurring, cumulative point goals (dvided into initial points (points accumulated from previous week)and weekly points(points allocated for that week) and implemented the logic according to these points.</li>
<li> User Story4 : Adding due dates for the incompleted tasks</li>
